## Movie Log Project

This project was developed in order to both polish and demonstrate my Python and Flask skills, as well as my ability to interface with APIs through ajax calls in javascript.

The result is a fully functional web application with a back end built using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. AJAX calls to The Movie Database (www.themoviedb.org) API and jQuery are used to provide real-time updates to the interface for adding movies and viewing user logs. The application uses Google and Facebook's OAuth APIs to create accounts and allow secure logins. Bootstrap is used for formatting. The application and its PostgreSQL database are hosted at Heroku.

Additional libraries used include Moment, a python library for formatting dates, and a Bootstrap template for star ratings.

The project is run using the movies.py file after structuring the database with the database_setup.py file.
